### structure

- each paragraph should start with a topic sentence - the reader should get understand what the paragraph should be about from the first sentence
- develop the argument in the rest of the paragraph
- conclude

### principles

- think of the overall story when you write
- ensure a logical order to your arguments and paragraphs
- avoid duplication - make the point once and make it well

### potential strategies
- write all the topic sentences first, then elaborate
  - Lucy's process: really detailed planning - how will you:
    - evidence or argue your thrust in the topic sentence
    - how does this relate back to the overall picture
- start from the figures, then topic sentences, then populate with words
