> ### project background

- from cancer standpoint
    - WGS of tumours - richness of information // accessibility of WGS has really opened the door to this level of patient data, and the ability to observe and understand the trends that make mutational signatures
    - enables us to see holistic patterns that are distinguishable of particular processes, despite the origin of the problem from a genetic standpoint
    - can build algorithms to classify tumours into signatures that suggest a particular process that is causing the cancer
    - but these algorithms suggest many women for whom they can't find a cause
    - where rare disease genomics comes in 
    - note that classifying these patterns is clinically relevant and super helpful, as is giving women a cause of their cancers
      - classification of cancers is helpful both to pick up patients that would've been missed, but also to identify the true nature of a cancer (the causative malfunctioning process), where it could be muddied by other mutations (s.n-z talk, last patient), which can have implications for the way that tumour should, or should not be treated - true personalised medicine

- from rare disease standpoint
  - the primary challenge in rare disease genomics is finding where to look (the right patients, and the right genes)
  - applying mutational signatures to identify cohorts of patients is a banging way of doing this
